# Windmill
MMP100-P5 project
This project is a windmill that speeds up and changes colors with each mouse click. Colorful particles 
continuously appear below the windmill. I was inspired by a childhood memory of a beautiful windmill seen in a 
TV show. The most challenging was managing color changes. Initially, I used two functions for each element to 
switch colors after reaching a certain threshold, but later I simplified the code by using “if” conditionals only 
where color changes were needed.
